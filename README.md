# Project Summary: Analyzing Uber Data in New York City
Objective: This project aimed to analyze Uber ride data in New York City to uncover insights related to pickup patterns, vehicle activity, rush hours, and popular locations. By using Python for data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization, I aimed to provide valuable insights that could help optimize Uber's services in the city.

## 1. Data Collection for Analysis: 
The first step was to load the Uber data into the environment, which contained records of Uber pickups, including details such as timestamp, pickup location, vehicle activity, and other relevant information. Data was sourced from a dataset that tracked Uber's operations in New York City over time.

## 2. Data Pre-processing and Cleaning: 
Data cleaning involved handling missing values, correcting data types (e.g., converting timestamps to proper datetime format), and removing any duplicates. I also made sure to filter out any anomalies and irrelevant data points to ensure the dataset was clean and ready for analysis.

## 3. Month with Maximum Uber Pickups in NYC: 
Through analysis of the dataset, I identified that June month has the highest number of Uber pickups. By grouping data by month and summing the pickups for each month, I discovered the peak month for Uber activity in New York City, revealing seasonality and demand fluctuations.

## 4. Hourly Rush in New York City: 
To understand the city's transportation demand throughout the day, I performed an analysis to determine the hourly rush. By aggregating the data based on hours,i have seen that Saturday and Sunday exhibit similar demand throughout the late night/morning/afternoon, but it exhibits opposite trends during the evening. In the evening, Saturday pickups continue to increase throughout the evening, but Sunday pickups takes a 
downward turn after evening. We can see that there the weekdays that has the most demand during the late evening is Friday and Saturday, which is expected, but what strikes me is that Thursday nights also exhibits very similar trends as Friday and Saturday nights.

## 5. Base Number with the Most Active Vehicles: 
One of the key findings was identifying which base_number (Uber's vehicle dispatch stations) had the most active vehicles. By grouping the data based on the base number and counting the active vehicles, I discovered B02764 base had the highest level of operational activity across the city.

## 6. Data Preparation for Analysis: 
The raw Uber data was pre-processed and transformed into a usable format by filtering necessary columns and ensuring that all timestamps were properly parsed. The cleaned data was ready for further analysis, allowing for efficient aggregation and exploration.

## 7. Locations of Rush in New York City: 
An important part of this analysis was identifying the most popular areas in New York City where Uber pickups were highest. By plotting the geographic coordinates of each pickup location, I was able to visualize a number of hot spots. Midtown Manhattan is clearly a huge bright spot & these are made from Midtown to Lower Manhattan followed by Upper Manhattan and the Heights of Brooklyn.

## 8. Pairwise Analysis of Rush Hours and Weekdays: 
To dig deeper into the patterns of Uber usage, I performed a pairwise analysis of rush hours and weekdays. This analysis showed how Uber demand fluctuated based on the day of the week and specific hours within the day. The findings helped identify not only peak times but also the days that had the highest level of activity, enabling better prediction of peak demand periods.

## 9. Automating the Analysis: 
Finally, I explored ways to automate the analysis process by creating reusable Python functions and scripts. This involved using libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations, and ensuring that the entire workflow, from data cleaning to analysis, could be repeated seamlessly for future datasets. The goal was to create a system that could easily handle new data and provide up-to-date insights on Uber's operations
